# Shopping-cart-2
React app with strapi database
This was an exercise for week 19 of the MIT fullstack course. 
The code here is the solution code provided by the course. 
It is intended to be able to put items into the cart, see the checkout and also be able to click on the bottom to re-stock from the strapi API.
